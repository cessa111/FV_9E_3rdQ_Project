		<h6>The sole purpose of this website is to inform people about the dos and don'ts of fire prevention. As stated on the main website, March is the month when the temperature and humidity start to reach higher levels, making this month one of the hottest months of this year. In addition, it is also the month with the most alarming fire incidents.

		<p>As we all may know, smoke contributes to air pollution. With all the environmental problems we have so far, we don't need more pollution to spread. Our situation is bad enough as it is. For the safety of the citizens of the Philippines, and the citizens from other countries that might be reading this (Hello!), and to help minimize the pollution on Earth, this website was created. </p> </h6>
